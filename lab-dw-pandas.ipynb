    "- Customer Lifetime Value - Customer lifetime value(CLV) is the total revenue the client will derive from their entire relationship with a customer. In other words, is the predicted or calculated value of a customer over their entire duration as a policyholder with the insurance company. It is an estimation of the net profit that the insurance company expects to generate from a customer throughout their relationship with the company. Customer Lifetime Value takes into account factors such as the duration of the customer's policy, premium payments, claim history, renewal likelihood, and potential additional services or products the customer may purchase. It helps insurers assess the long-term profitability and value associated with retaining a particular customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Income - Customers income\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monthly Premium Auto - Amount of money the customer pays on a monthly basis as a premium for their auto insurance coverage. It represents the recurring cost that the insured person must pay to maintain their insurance policy and receive coverage for potential damages, accidents, or other covered events related to their vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of Open Complaints - Number of complaints the customer opened\n",
